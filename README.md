This web application utilizes Leaflet, a JavaScript library designed for interactive maps, to exhibit real-time earthquake information obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The application retrieves earthquake data from the USGS API in GeoJSON format and presents it visually on an interactive map. Each earthquake is denoted by a circular marker on the map, where the marker's size corresponds to the earthquake's magnitude and its color represents the depth. By clicking on a marker, a popup appears, providing additional details about the earthquake, such as its location, magnitude, and depth.

To operate the application, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The map will load, displaying the most recent earthquake data from the USGS. You can zoom in and out, pan the map, and interact with the markers to access specific information about each earthquake. The base map is provided by OpenStreetMap.

This project exemplifies the integration of Leaflet, D3, and JavaScript to create an interactive visualization of data. It showcases the capabilities and adaptability of Leaflet in constructing compelling map-centric applications.
